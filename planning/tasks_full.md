      {/* Droppable zone for main track clips */}
    </div>
    <div className="track overlay-track">
      <div className="track-header">Overlay</div>

    if (destination.droppableId !== source.droppableId) {
      // Track changed (main → overlay or vice versa)
      const newTrack = destination.droppableId === 'main-track' ? 'main' : 'overlay';
      handleTrackChange(draggableId, newTrack);
    } else {
      // Same track, just reordered
      handleReorder(draggableId, source.index, destination.index);
    }
  };
  ```

**Acceptance:**
- Can drag clip to different track
- Can reorder within same track
- State updates correctly

---

#### Task 12.3: Update App State for Multi-Track

  ```javascript
  const handleTrackChange = (clipId, newTrack) => {
    setClips(clips.map(c =>
      c.id === clipId ? { ...c, track: newTrack } : c
    ));
    showToast(`Moved to ${newTrack} track`, 'success');
  };
  ```

**Acceptance:**
- Track property updates correctly
- UI reflects changes

---

#### Task 12.4: Update Preview for Multi-Track (30fps)

  - Use canvas or CSS overlay for preview
  - Maintain 30fps during multi-track preview
- [ ] Optional: Canvas-based compositing for live preview:
  ```javascript
  const renderPreview = (mainClip, overlayClip) => {
    const canvas = canvasRef.current;
    const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
    
    // Draw main
    ctx.drawImage(mainVideo, 0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
    
    // Draw overlay inset (if exists) at 30fps
    if (overlayClip) {
      ctx.drawImage(overlayVideo, canvas.width - 240 - 10, canvas.height - 240 - 10, 240, 240);
    }
    
    // Maintain 30fps refresh rate
    requestAnimationFrame(() => renderPreview(mainClip, overlayClip));
  };
  ```

**Acceptance:**
- Preview shows composite correctly
- Overlay visible on top of main
- 30fps maintained during multi-track preview

---

#### Task 12.5: Update Export for Multi-Track

  ```javascript
  async function exportTimeline(clips, outputPath) {
    const mainClips = clips.filter(c => c.track === 'main').sort((a, b) => a.order - b.order);
    const overlayClips = clips.filter(c => c.track === 'overlay').sort((a, b) => a.order - b.order);
    
    // Step 1: Export main track (concat main clips)
    const mainOutput = await concatClips(mainClips);
    
    // Step 2: If overlay clips exist, composite them on top
    if (overlayClips.length > 0) {
      const overlayOutput = await concatClips(overlayClips);
      
      // Use FFmpeg filtergraph to composite
      return ffmpegComposite(mainOutput, overlayOutput, outputPath);
    } else {
      // Just main track
      return mainOutput;
    }
  }
  
  function ffmpegComposite(mainPath, overlayPath, outputPath) {
    // FFmpeg command with overlay filter
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      ffmpeg(mainPath)
        .input(overlayPath)
        .complexFilter('[1]scale=320:240[pip];[0][pip]overlay=W-w-10:H-h-10')
        .output(outputPath)
        .on('end', () => resolve(outputPath))
        .on('error', reject)
        .run();
    });
  }
  ```

**Acceptance:**
- Export with single track (main only)
- Export with dual tracks (overlay composited)
- FFmpeg command works correctly

---

#### Task 12.6: Add Track Indicators
- [ ] Visual styling to distinguish tracks:
  ```css
  .main-track {
    background: #f9f9f9;
    border-bottom: 2px solid #ddd;
  }
  
  .overlay-track {
    background: #f0f8ff;
    border-bottom: 2px solid #ddd;
  }
  
  .track-header {
    padding: 8px;

    color: #666;
  }
  ```

expect(mainTracks.length + overlayTracks.length).toBe(clips.length);
```

#### Acceptance Test
```
Scenario: Edit with multi-track timeline
  Given I have 2 main clips and 1 overlay clip
  When I view the timeline
  Then I see 2 tracks labeled "Main" and "Overlay"
  And clips are on correct tracks
  When I drag overlay clip to different position
  And I preview
  Then I see composite (main + overlay inset)
  When I export
  Then exported video has composite correctly
```

    // Apply volume adjustment
    if (clip.audio.volume !== 1) {
      const volumeFilter = `volume=${clip.audio.volume}`;
      ffmpegCmd = ffmpegCmd.audioFilter(volumeFilter);
    }
    
    // Apply mute
    if (clip.audio.isMuted) {
      ffmpegCmd = ffmpegCmd.audioFilter('volume=0');
    }
    
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      ffmpegCmd
        .output(outputPath)
        .on('end', () => resolve(outputPath))

## Critical Path Dependencies

```
PR-1 (Boilerplate) → PR-2 (Import) → PR-3 (Preview) → PR-5 (Export)
                  ↓
                PR-4 (Trim) → PR-5 (Export)
                
                PR-6 (Reorder) → PR-5 (Export)
                
                PR-7 (UI Polish) — can run in parallel with others
                
                PR-8 (Testing) — must happen after MVP features complete

PR-9 (Screen Record) ┐
PR-10 (Webcam)      ├→ PR-12 (Multi-Track) → PR-15 (Release)
PR-11 (Composite)   ┘

PR-13 (Audio) → (optional, can add after PR-12)

PR-14 (Demo) → (can record after features tested)
```

**Key Insight:** Can parallelize: PR-2+3, PR-4+5, PR-9+10, and UI/Testing in parallel with core features.
