# Progress: ClipForge MVP

## What Works ✅

### PR-1: Project Setup & Boilerplate (COMPLETED)
*   **Electron Forge + React Setup:** Webpack configured for JSX, React 18 working
*   **File Structure:** Organized directories (electron/, src/, components/, utils/)
*   **IPC Bridge:** Secure communication via contextBridge, all stub handlers registered
*   **FFmpeg Integration:** Bundled for production (darwin-x64), working in both dev and packaged modes
*   **Main Process:** Window configured (1400x900), proper webPreferences, app lifecycle handled
*   **Build System:** Webpack configured, packaging working (`npm run make`)
*   **Git Repository:** Initialized with comprehensive README and .gitignore
*   **App Launch:** Both dev mode (`npm start`) and packaged app working perfectly

### PR-2: File Import & Timeline Display (COMPLETED)
1.  **Import Videos (Drag & Drop + File Picker):** Implemented functionality to import MP4/MOV files, extract metadata (duration, resolution), and generate thumbnails. Handled various edge cases like huge files, corrupt videos, and permission issues.
2.  **Timeline View (Clip List):** Developed a left panel to display imported clips with thumbnails, names, and durations. Clip deletion with visual feedback is implemented. Drag-and-drop reordering is moved to PR-6.

## What's Left to Build (Core Features - MVP)

### PR-3: Video Preview & Playback (COMPLETED)
3.  **Video Preview & Playback:** ✅ Successfully implemented comprehensive video preview functionality with HTML5 `<video>` element, play/pause controls, scrubber for seeking, keyboard shortcuts, and metadata display. All acceptance criteria met including smooth playback (30fps+), responsive seeking (< 500ms), and proper error handling. **All manual tests passed successfully.**

### PR-4: Trim Clips (COMPLETED)
4.  **Trim Clips (Simple In/Out Points):** ✅ Successfully implemented comprehensive trim functionality with ClipEditor component featuring number inputs for trim start/end points, validation logic with error handling, Apply/Reset buttons, and integration with VideoPreview to respect trim points during playback. All acceptance criteria met including trim validation, persistence, visual feedback, proper clamping behavior, and compact UI design. **All manual tests passed successfully including edge cases, multiple clips, and error recovery.**

### PR-5: Export Timeline to MP4 (COMPLETED)
5.  **Export to MP4 (Core Loop Completion):** ✅ Successfully implemented comprehensive export functionality with mediaProcessor.js handling FFmpeg operations, segment extraction with normalization, filter_complex concatenation, progress reporting via IPC, ExportDialog component with file picker and progress bar, Cmd+E keyboard shortcut, and robust error handling. All acceptance criteria met including proper clip ordering, trim application, audio/video sync, and user-friendly error messages. **All manual tests passed successfully including multi-clip exports, progress reporting, and error cases.**

### PR-6: Reorder Clips (Drag & Drop) (COMPLETED)
6.  **Drag-and-drop Reordering:** ✅ Successfully implemented drag-and-drop reordering using @dnd-kit packages (modern React 19 compatible alternative to react-beautiful-dnd). Timeline component updated with DndContext and SortableContext, SortableClipItem component created with full drag support, handleReorderClips function implemented in App.jsx with proper order property updates, visual feedback added (opacity, box-shadow, cursor changes), and mediaProcessor verified to sort clips by order before export. **All implementation tasks completed successfully with no console errors or linting issues.**

## Current Status

*   **PR-1 Complete:** Solid foundation established
*   **PR-2 Complete:** Core import and timeline display implemented
*   **PR-3 Complete:** Video preview and playback functionality implemented
*   **PR-4 Complete:** Trim clips functionality implemented with comprehensive testing
*   **PR-5 Complete:** Export timeline to MP4 with progress reporting and error handling
*   **PR-6 Complete:** Drag-and-drop reordering with visual feedback and keyboard support
*   **App Functional:** Launches successfully in both dev and production modes
*   **FFmpeg Working:** Successfully bundled and functional
*   **Architecture Ready:** All core components and IPC handlers for PR-1 through PR-6 in place
*   **UI Polish:** Compact, responsive design with proper error handling
*   **Next Up:** PR-7 (Responsive UI & Polish) and PR-8 (Testing, Packaging & Final Polish)

## Known Issues

*   **Dev Mode FFmpeg:** Requires `brew install ffmpeg` for development (not needed for packaged app)
*   **EGL Errors:** Normal macOS warnings, don't affect functionality
