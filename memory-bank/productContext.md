# Product Context: ClipForge MVP

## Why ClipForge Exists (Problems Solved)

ClipForge aims to provide a straightforward desktop video editing experience for users who need to perform basic operations quickly. It addresses the need for a simple tool to import, preview, trim, and export video clips without the complexity of professional-grade software.

## How ClipForge Should Work (Core User Journey)

Users should be able to:

1.  **Import Videos:** Easily drag and drop MP4/MOV/WebM files or use a file picker.
2.  **Record Content:** Capture screen, webcam, or both simultaneously with built-in recording tools.
3.  **Manage Timeline:** View imported and recorded clips in a professional horizontal timeline, reorder them via drag and drop, and delete unwanted clips.
4.  **Preview & Playback:** Select a clip to preview it with play/pause functionality and a scrubber for seeking.
5.  **Trim Clips:** Set precise start and end points for video segments using both drag-to-trim on timeline and simple text inputs, with the preview reflecting the trimmed section.
6.  **Export:** Combine the trimmed and ordered clips into a single MP4 file, selecting an output location, with a progress bar indicating export status.

*   **Reliable Core Loop:** The fundamental workflow (import â†’ preview â†’ trim â†’ export) must be robust and crash-free.
*   **Performance:** Playback should be smooth, and export times should be reasonable for typical demo videos (<3 minutes for a 2-minute timeline).
*   **Clear Feedback:** Users should receive clear visual feedback for actions (e.g., drag-and-drop highlights, loading spinners, success/error toasts).
