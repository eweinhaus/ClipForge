# Progress: ClipForge MVP

## What Works ✅

### PR-1: Project Setup & Boilerplate (COMPLETED)
*   **Electron Forge + React Setup:** Webpack configured for JSX, React 18 working
*   **File Structure:** Organized directories (electron/, src/, components/, utils/)
*   **IPC Bridge:** Secure communication via contextBridge, all stub handlers registered
*   **FFmpeg Integration:** Bundled for production (darwin-x64), working in both dev and packaged modes
*   **Main Process:** Window configured (1400x900), proper webPreferences, app lifecycle handled
*   **Build System:** Webpack configured, packaging working (`npm run make`)
*   **Git Repository:** Initialized with comprehensive README and .gitignore
*   **App Launch:** Both dev mode (`npm start`) and packaged app working perfectly

### PR-2: File Import & Timeline Display (COMPLETED)
1.  **Import Videos (Drag & Drop + File Picker):** Implemented functionality to import MP4/MOV files, extract metadata (duration, resolution), and generate thumbnails. Handled various edge cases like huge files, corrupt videos, and permission issues.
2.  **Timeline View (Clip List):** Developed a left panel to display imported clips with thumbnails, names, and durations. Clip deletion with visual feedback is implemented. Drag-and-drop reordering is moved to PR-6.

## What's Left to Build (Core Features - MVP)

### PR-3: Video Preview & Playback (COMPLETED)
3.  **Video Preview & Playback:** ✅ Successfully implemented comprehensive video preview functionality with HTML5 `<video>` element, play/pause controls, scrubber for seeking, keyboard shortcuts, and metadata display. All acceptance criteria met including smooth playback (30fps+), responsive seeking (< 500ms), and proper error handling. **All manual tests passed successfully.**

### PR-4: Trim Clips
4.  **Trim Clips (Simple In/Out Points):** Create controls (number inputs) to set trim start and end points for clips. Ensure validation, persistence of trim values, and visual feedback in the preview.

### PR-5: Export & Polish
5.  **Export to MP4 (Core Loop Completion):** Implement an export function that stitches all trimmed and ordered clips into a single MP4 file. This includes user selection of output location, a progress bar during export, and robust error handling for issues like disk space or permissions.
6.  **Error Handling & User Feedback:** Establish a comprehensive error handling system using toast notifications for user-friendly messages across all potential failure points (invalid files, FFmpeg issues, export failures).

### PR-6: Reorder Clips (Drag & Drop)
7.  **Drag-and-drop Reordering:** Implement drag-and-drop reordering for clips in the timeline, updating the state and ensuring export respects the new order.

## Current Status

*   **PR-1 Complete:** Solid foundation established
*   **PR-2 Complete:** Core import and timeline display implemented
*   **App Functional:** Launches successfully in both dev and production modes
*   **FFmpeg Working:** Successfully bundled and functional
*   **Architecture Ready:** All core components and IPC handlers for PR-1 and PR-2 in place

## Known Issues

*   **Dev Mode FFmpeg:** Requires `brew install ffmpeg` for development (not needed for packaged app)
*   **EGL Errors:** Normal macOS warnings, don't affect functionality
