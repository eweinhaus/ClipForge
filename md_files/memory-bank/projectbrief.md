# Project Brief: ClipForge MVP

## Core Project Requirements and Goals

The primary goal of the ClipForge MVP is to build a minimal desktop video editor (using Electron + React) that successfully demonstrates a core media pipeline: import → preview → trim → export. The focus is on achieving a **clean user experience (UX)** and a **complete core loop** rather than a rich feature set.

## Non-Negotiables for MVP Success:

*   The application must be runnable as a packaged macOS app (not in development mode).
*   All core features, as defined in the MVP, must function without crashes.
*   The User Interface (UI) must be intuitive and responsive.
*   FFmpeg must be bundled with the application, or its installation process must be clearly documented.
*   A demonstration of all features must be recordable within 5 minutes.
